![Family Portrait](/images/family-portrait.jpg)
My name is Nathan (Thomas) Reid. I'm a 32-year old software developer living in Austin, TX with my amazing wife and two young kids. I started programming in QBasic at the age of 9 and never looked back.
In my teens I spent countless hours attempting to build a sentient AI (and failing splendidly, of course!).

I love learning, designing, and creating new things. This blog is intended to be an outlet for my thoughts - perhaps some will be brilliant; many others will likely be misguided. My goal is to at least learn from myself as I draft these articles, and hopefully to gain input from my readers as well.

Much of my day is spent working with JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, MongoDB and SQL as I architect and develop web and mobile applications. In my personal "tech" time I focus on exploring new technologies and design patterns.

As such, I expect this blog to largely be filled with technical content, although that may be interspersed with articles about my myriad other interests such as tiny houses, backyard chickens, and blacksmithing.

I spend my spare time hanging with my family, playing violin, developing games, exploring new technologies, watching Big Bang Theory, and running around the Austin trails barefoot.
