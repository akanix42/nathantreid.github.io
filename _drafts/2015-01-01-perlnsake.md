I have loved developing games since I first started programming in 1995. I well remember the thrill of getting QBasic to draw 2 stick figures on the screen and making them fight each other.
In college, I was all about the Perl programming language, and spent my free time in the library crafting a game reminiscent of Rattler Race (a snake game on Windows 95).
The special features were:
1. procedurally generated levels
2. you could kill the other snake by eating it's head, and it could do the same to you. If you bit the the other snake'
s body, or vice versa, everything behind that point of your body would split off into more little snakes zipping around.
